# Fix_orderbook

This repository contains a FIX-based trading application that simulates order matching using an order book. The project is implemented in C++ and uses QuickFIX for FIX protocol communication.

## Features
- **Order Matching Engine**: Supports limit orders, market orders, and fill-and-kill orders.
- **FIX Protocol Support**: Implements FIX 4.4 for communication.
- **Aggregated Order Book**: Displays bids and asks after trades are executed.
- **Trade Execution Reports**: Sends execution reports as acknowledgments.

## File Structure
- `fixapp.h`: Defines the FIX application logic.
- `main.cpp`: Initializes the FIX engine and handles incoming orders.
- `orderbook.h`: Contains classes for managing orders and trades.
- `orderbook.cpp`: Implements the order matching algorithm.
- `trading_confi.cfg`: Configuration file for FIX engine settings.

## Configuration File (`trading_confi.cfg`)
Below is an example configuration file used by the application:

Below is an example configuration file used by the application:

[DEFAULT]
ConnectionType=initiator
HeartBtInt=30
FileStorePath=store
StartTime=00:00:00
EndTime=00:00:00
UseDataDictionary=Y
SocketConnectHost=app.fixsim.com # Replace with the actual simulator host

[SESSION]
BeginString=FIX.4.4
SenderCompID=pap865601@gmail_com # Provided by FIX Sim
